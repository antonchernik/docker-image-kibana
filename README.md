## Running in Development Mode

In the given example, Kibana will a attach to a user defined network (useful for connecting to other services (e.g. Elasticsearch)). If network has not yet been created, this can be done with the following command:

```console
$ docker network create somenetwork
```

*Note: In this example, Kibana is using the default configuration and expects to connect to a running Elasticsearch instance at http://localhost:9200*

Run Kibana

```console
$ docker run -d --name kibana --net somenetwork -p 5601:5601 kibana:tag
```

Kibana can be accessed by browser via `http://localhost:5601` or `http://host-ip:5601`

## Running in Production Mode
